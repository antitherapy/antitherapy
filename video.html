			<p class="vid-description">A confessional walk through the history and lives of the people of Manchester... Winner of the HOME DIY Film competition with a prize of £1000 to spend on film equipment and included mentoring with an industry professionals. </p>
			
			<br><p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/>
			<p class="vid-description">A disillusioned man face the reality of his actions from a long awaited visit... All the films on here have been written, shot-listed, directed and edited by me. I have a degree in Music Production, so I also do the foley, sound FX and music. </p>

			<p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/>
			<p class="vid-description">A misunderstood creature afraid of the world meets an optimistic companion, who challenges his reclusive nature. Experiments with stop motion and mask making, working with Samuel Collinge playing the monster.  </p>
			<p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/>
			<p class="vid-description">Freelance project working for Giacomo Bevaniti (as seen in London Fashion Week, Shon Magazine and Vogue amongst others), creating a portfolio piece for a competition for Louvre Art Award. We spent two days filming and taking photos before I edited the footage into a short ambient film showcasing the sculpting process and the final product.  </p>
						<p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/>
			<p class="vid-description">I independently documented the students' learning process, conducting interviews, and helping with teaching. I then edited hours of footage into a 5-minute film that was played in the cinema before the student's final piece. The final product was well-received and hopefully will give them something to remember the experience fondly.  </p>
									<p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/><p><br><p/>
			<p class="vid-description">This was more of an experiment, (I do not intend to be a YouTube personality!) to show a YouTube style edit. I used After Effects to create custom titles and transitions, and found stock footage and sound effects to create an engaging ‘educational’ video.</p>
